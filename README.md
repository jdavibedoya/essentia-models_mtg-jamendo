# Analysis of Essentia models on the MTG-Jamendo dataset

The main goal of this project is to compare the performance of some deep learning models that run on a large dataset of audio. The models are a subset of the TensorFlow classifiers available in [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/), and the dataset is a chunk of the [MTG-Jamendo dataset](https://github.com/MTG/mtg-jamendo-dataset).
